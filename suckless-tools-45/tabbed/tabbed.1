.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tabbed
is a simple tabbed container for applications which support XEmbed. Tabbed
will then run the provided command with the xid of tabbed as appended
argument. (See EXAMPLES.) The automatic spawning of the command can be
disabled by providing the \-s parameter. If no command is provided
tabbed will just print its xid and run no command.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
close tabbed when the last tab is closed. Mutually exclusive with \-f.
.TP
.B \-d
detaches tabbed from the terminal and prints its XID to stdout.
.TP
.B \-f
fill up tabbed again by spawning the provided command, when the last tab is
closed. Mutually exclusive with \-c.
.TP
.B \-h
will print the usage of tabbed.
.TP
.BI \-g " geometry"
defines the X11 geometry string, which will fixate the height and width of
tabbed.
Them form is [=][<width>{xX}<height>][{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>]. See
.BR XParseGeometry (3)
for further details.
.TP
.BI \-n " name"
will set the WM_CLASS attribute to
.I name.
.TP
.BI \-p " [ s +/-] pos"
will set the absolute or relative position of where to start a new tab. When
.I pos
is is given without 's' in front it is an absolute position. Then negative
numbers will be the position from the last tab, where \-1 is the last tab.
If 's' is given, then
.I pos
is a relative position to the current selected tab. If this reaches the limits
of the tabs; those limits then apply.
.TP
.BI \-r " narg"
will replace the
.I narg
th argument in
.I command
with the window id, rather than appending it to the end.
.TP
.B \-s
will disable automatic spawning of the command.
.TP
.BI \-t " color"
defines the selected background color.
.IR #RGB ,
.IR #RRGGBB ,
and X color names are supported.
.TP
.BI \-T " color"
defines the selected foreground color.
.TP
.BI \-u " color"

.TP
.BI \-U " color"

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
.B tabbed
by default uses Ctrl as Mod key and can be customized by creating a custom
config.h and (re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure and
simple.

Debian also provides the
.B tabbed.meta
alternative which uses the Windows key as Mod key.
